        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground Italian sausage (mild or hot)</li>
            <li>1 cup beef broth (or 1 cup water and 1 teaspoon Better Than Bouillon Beef Base)</li>
            <li>1 (25 oz) bag frozen ravioli</li>
            <li>1 (24 oz) can or jar of marinara sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pepperonis, cut into quarters (or you can use mini pepperonis)</li>
            <li>1 cup grated mozzarella</li>
            <li>3 cups fresh or frozen spinach</li>
        </ul>

        
        <ol>
            <li>Turn your Instant Pot to the saute function. When it is heated up add in the sausage. Brown the sausage in the pot. Deglaze the pot with the beef broth.</li>
            <li>Lay the ravioli on top of the sausage and broth. Pour the marinara sauce over the top of the ravioli. Don’t stir. Add in the pepperonis on top of the sauce.</li>
            <li>Cover the pot and secure the lid. Make sure valve is on “sealing.” Press the manual button or pressure cook button and set the timer to 1 minute.</li>
            <li>When the timer beeps indicating the time is up perform a quick release by moving the valve to “venting.” If any foam comes out move the valve back to sealing and wait 20 seconds before trying again.</li>
            <li>Remove the lid when you can. Stir in the mozzarella cheese and the spinach. When spinach cooks down a bit (it will literally take one minute) then serve the ravioli. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
